* Introduction*
* Ojbectives*: Might need some updates
* Methodology
  * Transformations: Digrams explaining the different transformations used, for example from OFF to png, OFF to Voxel, etc.
  * Examples: Images of transformation examples, a 3d in OFF and it's corresponding png and voxel. 3 examples.
  * Printing plan: Explain the software used for 3d Printing.

(*) From previous milestones

## Milestone 5: TA4

Continuation from the TA3 document:

* Methodology
  * Model architecture: a diagram of the generator and discriminator indicating number of parameter per layer in detail.
  * Training setup: Explain the setup used to train, colab, docker or whatever was used. Include a simple pseudocode of it.
  * 3D Printing: pictures of the printing process in the FabLab, screenshots of the SW used to configure the model, picture of teh printer and final model with and without support.

## Final Milestone: TF

Continuation from the TA4 document:

* Results: use graphs, tables and screenshots of the results of the model
* Conclusions
* References

## Performance Evaluation: DD
